Oh no, we forgot to add a few items to crypt_of_civilization! We have another
array called extra that has a few items:

extra = ["container of beer", "Lionel model train set", "Ingraham pocket watch"]

Write a single line of Ruby code that combines the contents of
crypt_of_civilization and extra into crypt_of_civilization

{% show_solution %}
```ruby
crypt_of_civilization = crypt_of_civilization + extra
```
{% endshow_solution %}
